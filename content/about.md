# Who are we

##### We focus in sustainable blockchain development and service.

We got into the crypto coin scene by mining Chia space coin, after that we found that there is a problem that is not easy to avoid, the mined coins are hard to generate economic value.

Except for Chia coin, all the others are small coins,  no interest income, not easy to mortgage and trade, etc. Therefore, we discussed together and finally chose to develop PlotBridge, it is to try to link space coins and smart chains through a bridge like this.

We developed the first version of the bridge in October 2021, which is a relatively rough webpage, but can test smart contracts and some basic functions. After a few months of testing and discussing with some space coin teams, we decided not to do publicity and promotion, and after the technical transformation to the second version of the test, we will consider whether to promote a large number of bridge according to its quality.

Now, the second version after the official online running test on April 24, 2022 ([https://www.plotbridge.io](https://www.plotbridge.io)), we ourselves and invited some friends to test various functions for a period of time. Now we think the bridge can meet the basic functional requirements (we are continuously improving the minor problems found on the webpage), it has become mature enough to invite more coins to participate in the bridge, and we are willing to share the growth with the (Space Coin) team.
