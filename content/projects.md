### PlotBridge: https://app.plotbridge.net

PlotBridge is a gateway/bridge between various plot-based blockchain networks (PoST networks like Chia, Chives, etc.) and mature smart blockchain networks (Binance Smart Chain, etc.) It can be used to wrap native coins like Chia(XCH), Chives(XCC) into corresponding tokens like PXCH, PXCC, and, course, unwrap tokens back into corresponding native coins.

        Currently supported coins:

            Chia(XCH)
            Chives(XCC)

        Currently supported smart chains:

            Binance Smart Chain (BSC)

We are always in the process of improving to provide a better user experience, so stay tuned.
